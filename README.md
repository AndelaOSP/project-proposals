# project-proposals
**To propose a project, go to [issues](https://github.com/LetsOpen/project-proposals/issues) and _create a new issue_. **

Including a project one-pager, as outlined in [the Guidelines Wiki](https://github.com/LetsOpen/guidelines/wiki/Attracting-a-team), will dramatically increase your chances of project approval.
